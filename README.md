# JarHC - JAR Health Check

A tool to statically analyze dependencies and references between a set of JAR (Java Archive) files, and to produce a report with all incompatibilities and potential issues. 
The goal is to give a qualitative answer to the question how "consistent" a set of JAR files is on binary API level.
