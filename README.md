# JarHC - JAR Health Check

JarHC is a static analysis tool to help you find your way through "JAR hell" or "classpath hell".

It's main purpose is to analyze a set of JAR files (\*.jar) and check whether they are compatible on a binary level, and whether they contain any "unpleasant surprises" for you.

More information can be found in the [wiki](https://bitbucket.org/smarkwal/jarhc/wiki).
